# Bevy Yoetz

Yoetz is a decision-making AI for the Bevy game engine.

## Features

* Describe the various strategies the AI agent can use by using a device macro on an `enum`.
* Write systems that suggest and score behaviors from that `enum`.
* AI informs user systems on the decision using the ECS (adds and removes components based on the strategy it chose)
* Suggestions can carry data that will appear in the strategy components. The exact behavior of that data can be customized in the derive macro.

## Example

Code: examples/example.rs

WASM: https://idanarye.github.io/bevy-yoetz/demos/example

Use the arrow keys to move the yellow square. The red square is controlled by AI. The AI's status is displayed above it.
